## Motivation 

While working on deep learning projects the models I had to work with were hosted on Google Drive, the problem 
with it is that its not straightforward to do wget from the sharable url as it's with dropbox. So I made 
this utility website [wget-google-drive.surge.sh](https://wget-google-drive.surge.sh/). It converts the 
Google Drive sharable url to wget script.

The website uses [blocks css.](https://thesephist.github.io/blocks.css/)

Here's the demo video :
