## Motivation 

This was the winning project of the Hexa Hive Hackathon. 

I worked in team with [Jainal](http://linkedin.com/in/jainal-gosaliya-75baa714a/) and [Adarsh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adarsh-gupta-447329154/).

In this project we developed a IOT device using  raspberry pi, web cam, ultra sonic sensor and buzzer.

In this project our goal was to provide a smart solution to manage attendace using Facial Recognition and 
also provide a solution for security solutions to colleges.

We have a React Js dashboard for Registration of student and another admin dashboard for viewing all the 
attendance of students. In this admin dashboard we can also view the triggered security events of 
unauthorised events.

We also use twilio to send sms to students and parents about their attendance.
