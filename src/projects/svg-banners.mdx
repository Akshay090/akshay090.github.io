## Motivation 

When I came accross this repo [css-in-readme-like-wat](https://github.com/sindresorhus/css-in-readme-like-wat), I got 
this idea that this could be used to make really cool GitHub Readme's, so I made a collection of similar 
svg's with help of projects from codepen. After that I converted all the svg's to be generated dynamically from 
api with Vercel, inspired from [github-readme-stats](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats).

Check it out at GitHub : [svg-banners](https://github.com/Akshay090/svg-banners)

This is my project with most number of stars ðŸŒŸ.
