## Motivation 

While working on a GitHub Action project I had to get the commnet text from the issue/pr comments. It was
not too straight forward so I created this project, which replies back with the same comment you have typed.
There is a separate implementation in email branch which retrives the GitHub public email of the comment 
author.
