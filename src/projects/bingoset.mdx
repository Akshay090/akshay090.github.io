## Motivation 

When building custom deep learning models collecting images can be a tedious task, so to solve this 
issue I made this cli tool to quickly create image datasets, it works with Bing Image Search API to 
fetch images.

It effectively handles edge cases for images when they are corrupted or have invalid source. 

Creating the dataset is as easy as 
```sh
bingoset q pikachu
```
this creates image dataset of pikachu with 250 images.
