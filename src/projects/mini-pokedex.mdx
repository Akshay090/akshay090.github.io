## Motivation 

Made this project while writing the [MSP Developer Stories blog](https://akshay-ashok.now.sh/posts/deeplearning-tutorial-azure/).

The classification model is trained on a custom dataset generated with images from bing image search api.
To generate the dataset I used [bingoset](https://github.com/Akshay090/bingoset), which is a CLI Toolkit 
to quickly create image dataset using Bing Image Search API.

The Deep learning part is done with [fast ai](https://www.fast.ai/). The backend part is done with starlette, 
and frontend is made using vanilla js.

I have explained each and every part of building this project in this blog post : [deeplearning-tutorial-azure](https://akshay-ashok.now.sh/posts/deeplearning-tutorial-azure/)
