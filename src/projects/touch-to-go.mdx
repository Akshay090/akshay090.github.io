## Motivation 

This project was made in the finals of Gujarat Industrial Hackathon. 

Worked in team with [Jainal](http://linkedin.com/in/jainal-gosaliya-75baa714a/), [Adarsh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adarsh-gupta-447329154/), 
[Dron](https://www.linkedin.com/in/drontrivedi/), [Siddharth](https://www.linkedin.com/in/siddharth-dayalwal/), [Trushant](https://www.linkedin.com/in/trushant-adeshara-34b109174/)

We were given the problem statement of creating Biometric fingerprint based attendance system integrated with 
MySql database which supports multiple checkin and checkout points.

I made the dashboard website and worked along my team on the IOT device we developed.

For the dashboard I used [arwes](https://github.com/arwes/arwes), it's a really cool framework to build 
futuristic interfaces with React.

The dashboard looked like this :

The IOT device is build with Raspberry pi 3b +, fingerprint sensor, speaker and lcd display.

Integrating the fingerprint sensor and MySql was a real challenge.

Here's the final demo video, it don't cover the dashboard part ðŸ˜¢
