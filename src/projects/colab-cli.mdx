## Motivation 

While working with my udacity deep learning moocs I had to deal with jupyter notebooks a lot and I happen 
to use Google Colab for the free GPU's. Now the thing is that if I had to commit the notebooks to GitHub 
like we do with our code or do it was not possible from the colab gui.

To solve the issue I made this cli tool to sync colab notebooks locally. 

Before colab-cli it required lot of work to commit files to GitHub as mentioned [in this blog post.](https://medium.com/@navan0/how-to-push-files-into-github-from-google-colab-379fd0077aa8) 
But now with just one command, you can get notebooks from colab to local pc, like 
```colab-cli pull-nb mynb.ipynb ```

Then you can commit it the usual way.

There are various other options and commands,
