## Motivation 

Built this project for the [Dev.to twilio hackathon](https://dev.to/devteam/announcing-the-twilio-hackathon-on-dev-2lh8). 
Its a twilio Chatbot connected with flask rest api. The flask server periodically scrapes the covid-19 data 
from the government website at [mohfw.gov.in](https://www.mohfw.gov.in/) to get the latest stats and makes this 
data accessible for chat bot with sqlite database. The scraping part was interesting, its done with BeautifulSoup, 
you can find it [here](https://github.com/Akshay090/break-the-chain/blob/master/app/cli.py).
