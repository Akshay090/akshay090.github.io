## Motivation 

After finishing the Coursera Golang Specialization I decided to use golang for building a sideproject to 
learn more about it. I had this idea of building a chrome extension from which we can perform the frequent 
git operations like commit, push and pull, after all that's what most of us need for basic use case.

I build the chrome extension using React/TypeScript and hooks. It was a really good learning experience. 
The chrome extension would communicate with the golang server, which runs in the taskbar (i was using 
windows back then). Its currently works on  window only, as I didn't found any good library to run golang 
server in a cross platform way as in the dock, taskbar, etc.

Here's the demo video :
