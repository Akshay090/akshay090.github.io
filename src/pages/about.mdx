## [my story](#my-story)


Back in my third grade, my dad bought home my first computer, since then I have been hooked to it.
But in those days I never did much more than play Vice City with my friends, I wish I learned some
programming at that time. I used to spend most of my time either gaming or reading books. I used to 
read a lot, my favorite series was the Percy Jackson & the Olympians, apart from this I used to read a 
lot of books by Sudha Murty and Amish Tripathi. From this list maybe you could tell that I liked reading 
about mythology, Mahabharat was my most favorite topic. The book that influenced me a lot was Stay hungry 
stay foolish by Rashmi Bansal, I learned a lot about how entrepreneurship and tech can make a 
difference. The idea of driving change with code is really fascinating. 

In 2017, I started my bachelor's in computer science. I have been to the various hackathon with my awesome team during 
these years and even been actively involved in creating developer community in campus, where we taught 
new tech to our fellow students on campus.

I have learned a lot by building projects and going to hackathons. The best and most important experience 
which I had was at EthIndia, I was able to attend this at the end of my first year, it was one of the 
best experience I ever had, I learned how much I didn't know and what to learn next.

Since then I have worked with 2 companies for internship and learned a lot there. Working in startups 
gives the most exposure and is a great learning experience. Currently, I'm working on my side projects and with my team on various projects. Â 

I will update later on how things proceed further.
